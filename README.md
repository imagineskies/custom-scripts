# Custom Linux Scripts

I am writing a bunch of bash scripts to help me when I reinstall linux. 
Working on building this myself to learn more about bash scripting and increse my proficiency. 
Originally, this had just been kept on my computer. However, someone else might think this is cool so why not upload it.

Right now it only has Debian based setup. Since I primarily use Debian, as a daily driver and for servers, I won't be including other distros just yet.
