# Custom Linux Scripts

I am writing a bunch of bash scripts to help me when I reinstall linux. 
Working on building this myself to learn more about bash scripting and increse my proficiency. 
Originally, this had just been kept on my computer. However, someone else might think this is cool so why not upload it.

As of now, my scripts will be targeted to a amd64 Debian system, since this is what I use. I won't be prioritizing other distros or architectures, but I might make a new branch for some arm scripts.
